            Welcome to Canada

        </h1>

        <p>
            Canada is a country in North America. Its ten provinces and three territories <br>
             from the Atlantic to the Pacific and northward into the Arctic Ocean, covering 9.98 <br>
             million square kilometres (3.85 million square miles), making it the world's second-<br>
             largest country by total area. Its southern and western border with the United States,<br>
              stretching 8,891 kilometres (5,525 mi), is the world's longest bi-national land border. <br>
              Canada's capital is Ottawa, and its three largest metropolitan areas are Toronto, Montreal, <br>
              and Vancouver. Indigenous peoples have contiuously inhabited what is now Canada for thousands <br>
               of years. Beginning in the 16th century, British and French expeditions explored and later settled <br>
               along the Atlantic coast. As a consequence of various armed conflicts, France ceded nearly all <br>
               of its colonies in North America in 1763. In 1867, with the union of three British North <br>
               American colonies through Confederation, Canada was formed as a federal dominion of four <br>
               provinces. This began an accretion of provinces and territories and a process of increasing <br>
               autonomy from the United Kingdom. This widening autonomy was highlighted by the Statute of <br>
                Westminster 1931 and culminated in the Canada Act 1982, which severed the vestiges of legal <br>
                dependence on the Parliament of the United Kingdom. Canada is a parliamentary democracy <br>
                and a constitutional monarchy in the Westminster tradition. The country's head of government <br>
                is the prime minister—who holds office by virtue of their ability to command the confidence <br>
                of the elected House of Commons—and is appointed by the governor general, representing the <br>
                monarch, who serves as head of state. The country is a Commonwealth realm and is officially <br>
                bilingual at the federal level. It ranks among the highest in international measurements of <br>
                government transparency, civil liberties, quality of life, economic freedom, and education. <br>
                It is one of the world's most ethnically diverse and multicultural nations, the product of <br>
                large-scale immigration from many other countries. Canada's long and complex relationship <br>
                with the United States has had a significant impact on its economy and culture. A highly <br>
                developed country, Canada has the 24th highest nominal per-capita income globally and the <br>
                sixteenth-highest ranking in the Human Development Index. Its advanced economy is the <br>
                ninth-largest in the world, relying chiefly upon its abundant natural resources and <br>
                well-developed international trade networks. Canada is part of several major international <br>
                and intergovernmental institutions or groupings including the United Nations, NATO, the G7, <br>
                the Group of Ten, the G20, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), <br>
                 World Trade Organization (WTO), the Commonwealth of Nations, the Arctic Council, the <br> 
                 Organisation internationale de la Francophonie, the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation <br>
                 forum, and the Organization of American States.
