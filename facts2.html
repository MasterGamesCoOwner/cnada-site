            The polar bear (Ursus maritimus) is a hypercarnivorous bear whose native range lies <br>
         largely within the Arctic Circle, encompassing the Arctic Ocean, its surrounding seas <br>
         and surrounding land masses. It is the largest extant bear species, as well as the <br>
          largest extant land carnivore.[6][7] A boar (adult male) weighs around 350–700 kg <br>
          (770–1,540 lb),[8] while a sow (adult female) is about half that size. Although it <br>
          is the sister species of the brown bear,[9] it has evolved to occupy a narrower <br>
          ecological niche, with many body characteristics adapted for cold temperatures, <br>
            for moving across snow, ice and open water, and for hunting seals, which make up <br>
            most of its diet.[10] Although most polar bears are born on land, they spend most <br>
              of their time on the sea ice. Their scientific name means "maritime bear" and <br>
          derives from this fact. Polar bears hunt their preferred food of seals from the <br>
          edge of sea ice, often living off fat reserves when no sea ice is present. <br>
               Because of their dependence on the sea ice, polar bears are classified as <br>
                 marine mammals.[11]  Because of expected habitat loss caused by climate <br>
                  change, the polar bear is classified as a vulnerable species. For decades, <br>
                   large-scale hunting raised international concern for the future of the species, <br>
                    but populations rebounded after controls and quotas began to take effect.[12] <br>
                     For thousands of years, the polar bear has been a key figure in the material, <br>
                      spiritual, and cultural life of circumpolar peoples, and polar bears remain <br>
                       important in their cultures. Historically, the polar bear has also been known <br>
                        as the "white bear".[13] It is sometimes referred to as the "nanook", based <br>
                         on the Inuit term nanuq.[14]
